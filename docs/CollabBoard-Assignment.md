# CollabBoard

*Building Real-Time Collaborative Whiteboard Tools with AI-First Development*

---

## Before You Start: Pre-Search (1 Hour)

After you review this document but before writing any code, complete the Pre-Search methodology at the end of this document. This structured process uses AI to explore stack options, surface tradeoffs, and document architecture decisions. **Your Pre-Search output becomes part of your final submission.**

This week emphasizes AI-first development workflows. Pre-Search is the first step in that methodology.

## Background

Miro solved hard problems: real-time synchronization, conflict resolution, and smooth performance while streaming data across networks. Multiple users brainstorm, map ideas, and run workshops simultaneously without merge conflicts.

This project requires you to build production-scale collaborative whiteboard infrastructure, then extend it with an AI agent that manipulates the board through natural language. The focus is on AI-first development methodology—using coding agents, MCPs, and structured AI workflows throughout the build process.

**Gate: Project completion is required for Austin admission.**

## Project Overview

One-week sprint with three deadlines:

| Checkpoint | Deadline | Focus |
|---|---|---|
| Pre-Search | Monday (one hour in) | Architecture, Planning |
| MVP | Tuesday (24 hours) | Collaborative infrastructure |
| Early Submission | Friday (4 days) | Full feature set |
| Final | Sunday (7 days) | Polish, documentation, deployment |

---

## MVP Requirements (24 Hours)

Hard gate. All items required to pass:

- [ ] Infinite board with pan/zoom
- [ ] Sticky notes with editable text
- [ ] At least one shape type (rectangle, circle, or line)
- [ ] Create, move, and edit objects
- [ ] Real-time sync between 2+ users
- [ ] Multiplayer cursors with name labels
- [ ] Presence awareness (who's online)
- [ ] User authentication
- [ ] Deployed and publicly accessible

> A simple whiteboard with bulletproof multiplayer beats a feature-rich board with broken sync.

## Core Collaborative Whiteboard

### Board Features

| Feature | Requirements |
|---|---|
| Workspace | Infinite board with smooth pan/zoom |
| Sticky Notes | Create, edit text, change colors |
| Shapes | Rectangles, circles, lines with solid colors |
| Connectors | Lines/arrows connecting objects |
| Text | Standalone text elements |
| Frames | Group and organize content areas |
| Transforms | Move, resize, rotate objects |
| Selection | Single and multi-select (shift-click, drag-to-select) |
| Operations | Delete, duplicate, copy/paste |

### Real-Time Collaboration

| Feature | Requirements |
|---|---|
| Cursors | Multiplayer cursors with names, real-time movement |
| Sync | Object creation/modification appears instantly for all users |
| Presence | Clear indication of who's currently on the board |
| Conflicts | Handle simultaneous edits (last-write-wins acceptable, document your approach) |
| Resilience | Graceful disconnect/reconnect handling |
| Persistence | Board state survives all users leaving and returning |

### Testing Scenarios

We will test:

1. 2 users editing simultaneously in different browsers
2. One user refreshing mid-edit (state persistence check)
3. Rapid creation and movement of sticky notes and shapes (sync performance)
4. Network throttling and disconnection recovery
5. 5+ concurrent users without degradation

### Performance Targets

| Metric | Target |
|---|---|
| Frame rate | 60 FPS during pan, zoom, object manipulation |
| Object sync latency | <100ms |
| Cursor sync latency | <50ms |
| Object capacity | 500+ objects without performance drops |
| Concurrent users | 5+ without degradation |

## AI Board Agent

### Required Capabilities

Your AI agent must support at least 6 distinct commands across these categories:

**Creation Commands**
- "Add a yellow sticky note that says 'User Research'"
- "Create a blue rectangle at position 100, 200"
- "Add a frame called 'Sprint Planning'"

**Manipulation Commands**
- "Move all the pink sticky notes to the right side"
- "Resize the frame to fit its contents"
- "Change the sticky note color to green"

**Layout Commands**
- "Arrange these sticky notes in a grid"
- "Create a 2x3 grid of sticky notes for pros and cons"
- "Space these elements evenly"

**Complex Commands**
- "Create a SWOT analysis template with four quadrants"
- "Build a user journey map with 5 stages"
- "Set up a retrospective board with What Went Well, What Didn't, and Action Items columns"

### Tool Schema (Minimum)

```
createStickyNote(text, x, y, color)
createShape(type, x, y, width, height, color)
createFrame(title, x, y, width, height)
createConnector(fromId, toId, style)
moveObject(objectId, x, y)
resizeObject(objectId, width, height)
updateText(objectId, newText)
changeColor(objectId, color)
getBoardState() // returns current board objects for context
```

### Evaluation Criteria

| Command | Expected Result |
|---|---|
| "Create a SWOT analysis" | 4 labeled quadrants (Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, Threats) |
| "Arrange in a grid" | Elements aligned with consistent spacing |
| Multi-step commands | AI plans steps and executes sequentially |

### Shared AI State

- All users see AI-generated results in real-time
- Multiple users can issue AI commands simultaneously without conflict

### AI Agent Performance

| Metric | Target |
|---|---|
| Response latency | <2 seconds for single-step commands |
| Command breadth | 6+ command types |
| Complexity | Multi-step operation execution |
| Reliability | Consistent, accurate execution |

## AI-First Development Requirements

This week emphasizes learning AI-first development workflows. You must document your process.

### Required Tools

Use at least two of:

- Claude Code
- Cursor
- Codex
- MCP integrations

### AI Development Log (Required)

Submit a 1-page document covering:

| Section | Content |
|---|---|
| Tools & Workflow | Which AI coding tools you used, how you integrated them |
| MCP Usage | Which MCPs you used (if any), what they enabled |
| Effective Prompts | 3-5 prompts that worked well (include the actual prompts) |
| Code Analysis | Rough % of AI-generated vs hand-written code |
| Strengths & Limitations | Where AI excelled, where it struggled |
| Key Learnings | Insights about working with coding agents |

### AI Cost Analysis (Required)

Understanding AI costs is critical for production applications. Submit a cost analysis covering:

**Development & Testing Costs**

Track and report your actual spend during development:

- LLM API costs (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.)
- Total tokens consumed (input/output breakdown)
- Number of API calls made
- Any other AI-related costs (embeddings, hosting, etc.)

**Production Cost Projections**

Estimate monthly costs at different user scales:

| 100 Users | 1,000 Users | 10,000 Users | 100,000 Users |
|---|---|---|---|
| $___/month | $___/month | $___/month | $___/month |

Include assumptions: average AI commands per user per session, average sessions per user per month, token counts per command type.

## Technical Stack

### Possible Paths

| Layer | Technology |
|---|---|
| Backend | Firebase (Firestore, Realtime DB, Auth), Supabase, AWS (DynamoDB, Lambda, WebSockets), custom WebSocket server |
| Frontend | React/Vue/Svelte with Konva.js, Fabric.js, PixiJS, HTML5 Canvas, Vanilla JS, any framework with canvas support |
| AI Integration | OpenAI GPT-4 or Anthropic Claude with function calling |
| Deployment | Vercel, Firebase Hosting, or Render |

Use whatever stack helps you ship. Complete the Pre-Search process to make informed decisions.

## Build Strategy

### Priority Order

1. **Cursor sync** — Get two cursors moving across browsers
2. **Object sync** — Create sticky notes that appear for all users
3. **Conflict handling** — Handle simultaneous edits
4. **State persistence** — Survive refreshes and reconnects
5. **Board features** — Shapes, frames, connectors, transforms
6. **AI commands (basic)** — Single-step creation/manipulation
7. **AI commands (complex)** — Multi-step template generation

### Critical Guidance

- Multiplayer sync is the hardest part. Start here.
- Build vertically: finish one layer before starting the next
- Test with multiple browser windows continuously
- Throttle network speed during testing
- Test simultaneous AI commands from multiple users
